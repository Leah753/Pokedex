# Pokedex
This project was created as an assignment. It is ment to show off my ability to grab information from a .json file and display the information on a web page. The information should display correctly even if information is changed or added to the .json file.

## What it does
The project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSON and diplays information about pokemon.
 
Pokedex takes information from a .json file currenlty containing the first generation of pokemon, and displays the information in a card on a webpage. 
It also has a section for statistics where information about each pokemon is added up and used to create a statistic such as average speed or number of water types.
